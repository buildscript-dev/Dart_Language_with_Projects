Here are 15 real-world command-line project ideas for you, grouped by difficulty to help you level up your skills!

Level 1: Foundational Projects

These projects will help you master the basics of user input, conditional logic, and simple data storage within your program.

    Simple To-Do List Manager: A program where you can add, view, and delete tasks. This will teach you how to handle a list of items and take user commands.

    Basic Calculator: A calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers provided by the user.

    Unit Converter: A program that converts between different units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, kilometers to miles). You can start with just one conversion and then add more.

    Password Generator: Generates a random, secure password based on user-defined length and character set (e.g., include numbers, symbols).

    Tip Calculator: Calculates the tip and total bill amount given the bill total and the desired tip percentage.

Level 2: Intermediate Projects

Now, let's add file I/O and more complex data structures. These projects will teach you how to persist data and work with more organized information.

    File Organizer/Renamer: A utility that scans a specified directory and renames files based on a pattern (e.g., invoice_001.pdf). This involves interacting with the file system.

    Contact Management System: A program to store and retrieve contact details (name, phone number, email) in a file. This is a great way to learn about reading from and writing to files.

    Budget Tracker: An application that lets you record expenses and income, and then provides a summary of your spending. You'll use data structures to store transactions and file handling to save them.

    Simple Word Counter: A tool that takes a text file as input and reports the number of words, lines, and characters.

    CSV Data Analyzer: A program that reads data from a CSV file (like a spreadsheet) and can perform simple analysis, such as calculating the average of a specific column.

Level 3: Advanced Projects

These projects will challenge you with more complex logic, external dependencies, and object-oriented programming.

    Command-Line Quiz Maker: A program that reads questions and answers from a file and administers a quiz to the user, tracking their score.

    Weather Application: Uses an HTTP package to connect to a public weather API, retrieves data for a user-provided city, and displays the current weather and forecast.

    Stock Price Tracker: Similar to the weather app, this project connects to a public stock API to retrieve and display real-time stock prices for tickers entered by the user.

    Directory Tree Visualizer: Scans a directory and its subdirectories and prints a graphical representation of the folder structure using ASCII art.

    System Resource Monitor: A tool that displays information about the computer's CPU, memory, and disk usage by interacting with the operating system.
